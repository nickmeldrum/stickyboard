# Stickyboard

Sorta like Google Keep with columns - possibly useful for kanban/scrum/retro boards and the like?

For detailed information on the client see the README at `~/clients/web/README.md`.
For detailed information on the backend see the README at `~/server/README.md`.

# Running

Only works in dev at the moment.

Web client uses CRA - so `yarn start` to start it :)
Server uses Express - also `yarn start` to start it (it uses nodemon as a file watcher :)


## TODO

### Web client

 * 

### Mobile client

 * Make one! :P
 * React native
 * share code with web?

### Backend

 * research and setup cognito auth - with facebook/google/github integration?
 * look into how easy cognito/dynamo/gateway??? without server would be?
